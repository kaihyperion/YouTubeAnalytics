UCysoqut76wsYjcTFQIXlkHw,Powder Blue,The Hot Takes Show Ep. 1: A Beanie Is Not A Hat,nA2t9ST7bAI,"In the pilot episode of ""The Hot Takes Show,"" Jake Liker argues why a beanie isn't a hat, while George Irving shares his thoughts on why umbrellas are dumb. Host Andrew Fenichel moderates the conversation, determines who has the hotter take, and makes sure to stop by downtown Chicago to hear what the people of the city had to say about the beanie debate.

At its core, THTS is a satirical take on Hot Take Culture. Nothing truly productive can come out of an hour-long show where two grown men yell at each other; thatâ€™s just not how discourse is intended to work. Itâ€™s inherently silly and should be treated as such, and thatâ€™s what we intended to channel in creating our show.
